# ProjectEuler

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

This repo contains my exercises in practicing common algorithms. Most of them will be from projecteuler.com, and some of
them are supplemental to that list.

The lion's share of the relevant code is located in /src/app/


## To Launch App:
- Clone repo to local machine
- In repo's directory in terminal do ```npm start```

## TODO:
- Think about ways to further break out problem groups in intuitive ways. solutions.service.ts is soon to be very large...
- Set up input fields for some/all of the problems completed to allow for user provided values to solve for.
